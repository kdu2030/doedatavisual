<h2>Background Information</h2>

<p>Our team was tasked with analyzing data about counties in Virginia arranged in a “horseshoe” design and evaluating the level that they are underserved.  Efforts to support these counties have gone underway in the Rural Horseshoe Initiative; we worked to determine which counties deserved assistance from this and other organizations.  In order to do this, we analyzed the levels of education, income, and cost of living in all of the counties.  We felt that these factors portrayed a truer image of what was truly occurring within these counties.  </p>

<h2>About RISE</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "paragraph">
<div class = "container">
<p>RISE is a web application dedicated to increase awareness about the Virginia Rural Horseshoe. By utilizing the innovative software of Tableau, RISE enables users to compare and contrast the education levels, income, cost of living, etc. of different counties. Users can also learn about which counties are actually in the Rural Horseshoe as well as conclusions that can be derived from the data through the other pages of the web application. The RISE team is composed of tenth and eleventh grade students from the Center for Information Technology at Deep Run High School. Each of us has experience in programming both websites and java. We also have project management classes which helped us prepare for and plan out our approach to our website.</p>

<h2>Development Process</h2>

<p>This project was started in Februrary of 2018. We began our endeavor by finding accurate and relevant deta sets about the state of Virginia. After finding the data sets which gave us crucial information like income and cost of living, we compiled this into Tableau and created an interactive visualization. This visualization allows the user to hover over and click on a county in the corresponding data category to find data about that category. During this time, we coded the website as well as wrote its content. Finally, we edited the content and finalized the design of the website through css. The web application was finished in April of 2018.</p>
